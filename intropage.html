    <p class="typing">The sliding puzzle will portray the story of Daedalus and Icarus, one of the most memorable adventures in all of Greek legend. Daedalus betrayed King Minos and is consequently banished, along with his son Icarus, into the centre of a labyrinth. Daedalus applies his skills as an inventor to build wings out of wax so that they can escape. He warns his son that the only thing he mustnâ€™t do is fly too close to the sun, otherwise the wax will melt. Both men take off with their wings, however Icarus cannot help but show off his bravado and continually flies upwards, disobeying his father. The wings melt, and poor Icarus falls to his death.</p>
